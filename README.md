## Troubleshooting
>Hub returns *422 Invalid value for "base"* when running `hub pull-request`.

[As discussed in this issue](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/154#issuecomment-410277347), just set the base branch of the remote:

```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```

> Tmux plugins won't load
[Install `gawk`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/issues/146)
```bash
brew install gawk
```

>Neovim is all blue
Run iTerm, not the Terminal app
